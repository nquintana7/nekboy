# Nekboy
This is a in development Gameboy (DMG-01) Emulator written in Java, during my free time just for fun/ to learn about the architecture.

## Status
* Runs Pokemon Red. I haven't played much but so far looks good. 
* Partially implemented MBC1, MBC3 and external ram in order to play Pokemon Red. No other MBC Implementation yet. Saves are yet not implemented.
* Passes almost all CPU Instructions Blarggs test.
* Timer and Interrupts are yet not correctly implemented (probably).
